    "Due to recent events that are impacting the nation, I wanted to create something that mixed what I learned in class and what I am continuing to learn about Black lives being impacted in America. These issues are also becoming topics of conversation in other courses at UCSD and I wanted to produce something I would actually use Python to make. It resulted in creating a Chatbox whose goal is to inform, educate and produce information about the Black Lives Matter Movement in order to create discourse around current issues at hand and honor those that are risking their lives to combat police brutality. It will run through three different topics and provide links to pages that will better inform our users of the movement. Thank you so much! \n",

On May 25, 2020 the police were called on a fake bill found at the store. The incident led to Floyd being handcuffed and forced on the ground with officer Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck for 8 minutes and 26 seconds. After repeating that he couldn't breathe, George Floyd died according to an independent autopsy report from asphyxiation. Floyd was a coach, a father, a son and a citizen who had his life taken over a non-threatening alleged issue.\\nUnfortunately, George Floyd is among the thousands of Black lives that are killed every year. Other American citizens like Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Abery along with countless others who have had their lives ended over police brutality are being advocated to reopen their cases to start a fresh investigation in order to get justice.

During the Jim Crow era, these police departments developed primarily as means to control freed slaves who were now laborers in the agricultural system. Currently, California has updated their spending plan which adds a $147.5 million increase to the police budget, resulting in excessive militarization of the police force.
