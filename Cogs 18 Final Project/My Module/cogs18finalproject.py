    george = "\nGeorge Floyd was a 46 year old black man living in Minneapolis. He had an altercation with the police that ended his life. On May 25, 2020 the police were called on a fake bill found at the store. The incident led to Floyd being handcuffed and forced on the ground with officer Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck for 8 minutes and 26 seconds. After repeating that he couldn't breathe, George Floyd died according to an independent autopsy report from asphyxiation. Floyd was a coach, a father, a son and a citizen who had his life taken over a non-threatening alleged issue.\nUnfortunately, George Floyd is among the thousands of Black lives that are killed every year. Other American citizens like Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Abery along with countless others who have had their lives ended over police brutality are being advocated to reopen their cases to start a fresh investigation in order to get justice. Would you like to learn more about these stories? "
    history = "\nThe history of the modern police originated in the American south from slave patrols whose primary purpose was to in order to 1) chase down, apprehend and return runaway slaves 2) provide a form of organized terror to deter slave revolts and 3) maintain a form of discipline for slaves, if violated any plantation rules. During the Jim Crow era, these police departments developed primarily as means to control freed slaves who were now laborers in the agricultural system. Currently, California has updated their spending plan which adds a $147.5 million increase to the police budget, resulting in excessive militarization of the police force. Due to recent uprisings of American civilians in the peaceful protest of excessive police force on Black lives, the police have been equipped with gear such as tear gas, rubber bullets, armour, batons, shields and water cannons to deter and disband these protesters which have been causing deaths. Would you like to know more about the history of police brutality in the United States? "
